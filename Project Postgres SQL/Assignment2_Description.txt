Assignment Description:

1.Objective:

Count the number of email messages per organization (domain name of the email address) in a given mailbox data file (mbox.txt).
Use a database with a specified schema (Counts table with columns org and count) to maintain the counts.

2.Schema:

Create a table named Counts with columns:
org (TEXT): Represents the organization (domain name).
count (INTEGER): Represents the count of email messages for that organization.

3. Expected Output:

After running the program on mbox.txt, the resulting database should contain the counts.
The expected output includes displaying the counts in descending order.

4. Data File:
mbox.txt contains sample email data with various email addresses and organizations.

5.Submission:
Upload the resulting database file for grading.

Provided Python Script:--

1. File Input:
Asks the user to enter the file name (default is mbox.txt).
Opens and reads the specified file.

2.Database Connection:
Defines functions to create or connect to an SQLite database (email_counts.sqlite) and create the Counts table if it doesn't exist.

3.Update Counts:
Defines a function to update or insert counts into the database based on the organization.

4.Processing Email Data:
Iterates through each line in the file.
Identifies lines starting with 'From ' to extract email addresses and corresponding domain names.
Updates the counts in the database for each organization.

5.Retrieve and Print Counts:
Retrieves the counts from the database and prints them in descending order.

6.Closing Database Connection:
Closes the SQLite database connection.

Instructions for Running:-
Requirements:
Install SQLite module by (pip install sqlite).
Run the script in a directory with write permissions to create the SQLite database file.
Execution:

Run the script and provide the file name when prompted.
The script processes the data, updates the database, and prints the counts.
Output:

The counts are displayed in descending order of email messages per organization.
